# AI Voice Agent Pipeline (Azure AI Speech)

This project implements an AI voice agent pipeline using **Azure AI Speech**.
The pipeline allows for voice interaction between users and an AI agent with
customizable settings such as dialog speed, agent functionality, and the initial
greeting.

The codebase is written in **Next.js**. The setup process and customization
options are detailed below.

## Installation

## Environmental Variables

OPEN_AI API KEY:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
AZURE TTS:
```
TTS_REGION=
TTS_KEY=
SPEECH_REGION=
SPEECH_KEY=
```

## Customization
1. **Startring Message**: 
    Change the initial greeting or starting message that the AI agent says to the user.
    Look for the ```startingMessage.ts``` file in the api route and modify its value.

2. **Agent Functionality**: 
    You can adjust the functionality of the voice agent in ```chat``` api, including how it processes input and responds. Custom agent logic can be added to the core AI processing functions.

3. **Input Submission Speed (Dialog Gap)**: 
    The speed at which the agent recognizes gaps in the userâ€™s input can be tweaked.
    Adjust the time between dialog interactions (the waiting time for input) by modifying the ```timeSinceLastUpdate`` setting in useEffect().


## Next Steps
Improving the Interruption Mechanism: The current version of the pipeline can be further improved to handle interruptions more smoothly (i.e., the user speaking over the agent). Future updates should focus on enhancing this feature.
